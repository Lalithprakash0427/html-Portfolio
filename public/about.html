<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a passionate and dedicated learner, I am currently a second-year B.Tech student specializing in Cloud Computing. My journey in web development began with mini HTML projects, including a movie ranking system and a birthday invitation webpage, which sharpened my skills in crafting user-friendly designs and functionalities. This hands-on experience not only nurtured my technical abilities but also fueled my curiosity for creating innovative digital solutions.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I am ambitiously working toward becoming a professional software web developer. To achieve this goal, Iâ€™ve taken the initiative to enroll in web development courses, equipping myself with cutting-edge tools and technologies essential for the industry. By tackling each concept one step at a time, I aim to build a portfolio that showcases my growth, creativity, and problem-solving capabilities.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I am an introvert who finds joy in playing mobile games and indulging in captivating stories on OTT platforms like Hotstar. My hobbies, combined with my analytical mindset, help me stay balanced while enhancing my ability to focus on detailed tasks. Through my portfolio, I hope to connect with opportunities that match my vision of creating impactful web solutions</p>
